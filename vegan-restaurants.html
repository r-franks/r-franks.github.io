            <h1>Vegan Restaurant Review!!!</h1>
            <p>
                My girlfriend and I have traversed the world (mostly the greater Chicago Area) in search of delicious vegan food. Here is our ranking of vegan places. Note that the perceived quality of a restaurant can depend heavily on the specific entrees ordered and picking the right entree can be a matter of luck. For this reason, we seek to be specific about what we liked and didn't.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>#1: Alice and Friends (Edgewater, Chicago)</h2>
            <p>
                Alice and Friends is an asian fusion vegan restaurant, and one of the few restaurants with vegan crab rangoon. Its crab rangoon is extremely good &#8212; I consider it the single best vegan dish I've ever had. They have a range of other tasty appetizers as well like drumstucks and popcorn nuggets, which I prefer in that order but do not beat the crab rangoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as entrees go, their Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap and Tom Ka Noodles are fantastic. They periodically have specials like a thanksgiving vegan roast which is also great. Their Banh Mi was very good but the fake meat and veggies were not well-integrated so it was hard to enjoy both in one bite &#8212; limiting the flavor profile compared to other Banh Mis we have had. Other entrees like Laksa and roasted sesame miso ramen were okay but nothing to write home about.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, the fantastic appetizers and their selection of extremely good entrees have made Alice and Friends our top vegan restaurant.
            </p>
            <h2>#2: Old Abe's Coffee Shop (Rochester Mn)</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/eW3UGqkyKOk?t=51">Believe it or not, the best Banh Mi of my life was in Rochester Minnesota.</a> Old Abe's banh mi (with jalapenos and vinegar chilli) and their (PETA approved!) spicy salmon bowl are some of the best vegan entrees I've ever had. Moreover, the other entrees we tried were also great, though less good. The seasonal leftovers sandwich (December), Korean BBQ bulgogi, and citrus ribs, and banh mi bowl were also very good (and I would rank them from best to worst in that order). We could get an entree for eleven dollars, which is frankly heroic in this economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Old Abe's has far more than just some of the best entrees we've ever had. They also have a fantastic line-up of vegan donuts included varieties including vanilla bourbon, Reese's, eggnog, lemon, springfield (like the donuts in the Simpsons), maple, and cinnamon sugar. All of these were fantastic and put the usual vegan donut scene to shame. Sometimes they rotate flavors in and out as well, and they have seasonal themed donuts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their vegan cinnamon rolls were also great, miles ahead of Chicago Diner's. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Old Abe's also has great drinks. Their eggnog was fantastic and the two more standard drinks were tried &#8212; Almond Joy and Zumbro &#8212; were great.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, no vegan restaurant we've been to has had such consistently good offerings of both entrees and of desserts. Alice and Friends is in the lead purely because of the unmitigated power of their crab rangoon.
            </p>
            <h2>#3: Fresh Mint (Scottsdale Az)</h2>
            <p>
                Fresh Mint serves vietnamese vegan food and their entrees are some of the best we've had. Their fresh mint tomatoes, soy fish in clay pot, and vegetarian black pepper steak were fantastic. Their fried imperial rolls were good as well and we had a strawberry mango smoothie which was nice. Ultimately though, they earned their high position on the merits and uniqueness of their entrees.
            </p>
            <h2>#4: Chicago Diner (Lakeview East, Chicago)</h2>
            <p>
                The Chicago Diner is a great restaurant for strong diner-style vegan food and good portions. Their food can be hit or miss but the ones that have hit for me &#8212; the dagwood (seasonal) and special recipe wings with buffalo sauce &#8212; really hit. Nevertheless, much of their food &#8212; the truffle mushroom lentil loaf, the cuban sandwich, gyros, the country fried steak, and Buddha's karma burger (ranked from best to worst) &#8212; was pretty good but not exceptional. Their main strength here was their portion size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be warned, however, that our experience has found their breakfast offerings to be pretty mediocre/boring &#8212; mainly because scrambled tofu is pretty boring. Their cinnamon rolls were alright, but a pale immitation of non-vegan ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, the Chicago Diner has very good milkshakes. Their pumpkin pie milkshake and chocolate chip cookie dough milkshakes are great. Their S'mores brownie sundae was fantastic (though keep in mind that tasty vegan ice-cream is easy to find at any grocery store).
            </p>
            <h2>#5: DAO Thai (Streeterville, Chicago</h2>
            <p>
                DAO Thai is not a vegan place. It is a Thai place, and most Thai places happen to have many vegan options. It is possible for very good Thai food that happens to be vegan to mop the floor with a lot of the deliberately vegan options that crop up these days. DAO Thai has some very good Thai food.
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, DAO Thai has fantastic panang curry that distinguishes itself by being heavy on peanut butter sauce (which we like). We usually order the panang curry with tofu and vegetables to give more substance to an otherwise high-liquid-to-stuff food. We also get the pad khee mao, which is very good. Beyond that, their Mussaman curry is also delicious, satisfying and potato-ey. We have also tried DAO's noodle delight and Cashew sauce stir fry, and while both were good, they weren't particularly exciting/flavorful.
            </p>
            <h2>#6: Veggie House (Chinatown, Chicago)</h2>
            <p>
                Veggie House is a Chinese vegetarian restaurant. The entrees we tried, the plant-based seafood kimchee noodle in soup and the Taiwan noodles were very good and good respectively &#8212; but were less exciting than the entrees at places higher on this list. Their vegetable tempura was delicious as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from Veggie House's wide menu of good (but not mindblowing) vegan entrees, they also had delicious sesame rice-balls which served as a tasty and unique dessert &#8212; and actually exciting desserts are often rare on the vegan scene. The entrees together with the dessert make Veggie House a consistently good restaurant. 
            </p>
            <h2>#7: Can't Believe It's Not Meat (Gold Coast Chicago)</h2>
            <p>
                Can't Believe It's Not Meat has a broad range of vegan offerings with hit-or-miss entrees and solid portion sizes. Their Philly CheeseSteak eggrolls was fantastic; their Fried Chik'n, Gumbo with Garlic Bread, and Churro Chicken and Waffle were pretty good; and their pizza poofs (too much poof, not enough pizza) and Greektown Gyro (lacking in flavor) were mediocre. Their french fries are also very good.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also have a number of good drinks / shakes. Their cookie monster shake and strawberry lemonade is great (though I think the Chicago Diner beats it in terms of shakes). Nevertheless, they do not provide complimentary water which we would appreciate quite a bit &#8212; especially given how spicey some of their food is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, Can't Believe It's Not Meat has some very good entrees but we've often ordered things we did not find very exciting. Still they've earned a pretty high ranking on the quality of their entrees.
            </p>
            <h2>#8: Madame Zuzu's Plantbased Emporium (Highland Park Illinois)</h2>
            <p>
                Madame Zuzu's has some frankly baffling entree options (tacos? for brunch?) but the entrees we tried were very good. We tried the Shanghai Rice Bowl, Carrot Lox Toast, and S'mores Donut for dessert. All were fantastic. In the background of the emporium was a live performance by an old-timey band. The food was great but everything was pretty pricey given the small portion sizes. If not for that, it would be higher on this list.
            </p>
            <h2>#9: Fancy Plants (Lakeview East, Chicago)</h2>
            <p>
                Fancy Plants is a great vegan restaurant with some fantastic entrees albeit with small portions. Their croissant sandwich is delicious and their lox bagel is also delicious. Their Smoked Lentil Lasagna was pretty good. We tried their Aztec Mocha Latte and Lavender vanilla latte, which were good but not as good as Old Abe's.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, the star of the Fancy Plants show is their vegan almond and chocolate croissants &#8212; they are the best vegan dessert we've had after Old Abe's donuts. We got some of their other pastries (coffee cake, banana bread, brownie, raspberry matcha muffin) via Too Good To Go and they were all pretty mediocre.
            </p>
            <p>
                The food quality is similar to Madame Zuzu's and the lox here beat the lox at Zuzu's. But Zuzu's has a much more fun ambiance. Like Zuzu's, this place could have been higher on the merits of its food if it wasn't rather pricey given the portion size.
            </p>
            <h2>#10: Veggie Village (Phoenix Arizona)</h2>
            <p>
                Veggie Village is a south-east Asian vegan place. We tried the salt & pepper eggplant, jab chae and something we frankly forgot about. The salt & pepper eggplant was delicious but the other two dishes were only decent and not very memorable.
            </p>
            <h2>#11: Native Foods (Wicker Park or Loop, Chicago)</h2>
            <p>
                Our favorite thing about Native Foods is their Nachos which are very tasty and filling. After that, we liked their orange cauliflower bowl and almost famous bowl. The cauliflower chickpea schwarma bowl was decent and filling. In general, its best to target the nachos and the bowls here because this is where the portions are reasonable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The buffalo chicken mac and cheese had a deeply unbalanced sauce to macaroni ratio which rendered it unfilling and somewhat perturbing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also tried the pumpkin cheesecake parfait for dessert, which was pretty good. Does it beat a Ben & Jerry's Dairy Dessert? Nope.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this restaurant has some tasty and well-portioned foods.
            </p>
            <h2>#12: Pizzeria Due (Streeterville, Chicago)</h2>
            <p>
                Pizzeria Due (and its famous twin, Pizzeria Uno) are famous for their deep dish pizza. They can also make their deep dish pizza with vegan cheese and, since their crust is vegan, this means that you can get a fully vegan veggie deep dish pizza with vegan cheese from Due's. In my opinion, this is the best vegan deep=dish pizza in Chicago, and is therefore probably one of the best vegan pizzas in the world (unless you prefer thin-crust). It's delicious and, since the deep dish pizza from Due's is massive, its definitely worth it portion-wise. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Pizzeria Due's deepdish with vegan cheese is amazing and the best in its class. It's only this low because, realistically speaking, we aren't feeling deepdish pizza that often.
