                <h2>The Russo-Ukrainian War</h2>
                    <p>
                        Last week, Russia invaded Ukraine &#8212 beginning the currently ongoing (as of 3/1/2022) <a href="" target="_blank">Russo-Ukrainian War</a>. Per this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If61baWF4GE" target="_blank">real life lore video</a> on the subject, Russia has several reasons for this action:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Claiming the large shale gas and oil reserves recently discovered in Ukraine</li>
                        <li>Eliminating Ukrainian tariffs on Russian oil delivered to Europe through Ukraine</li>
                        <li>Eliminating the possibility of a NATO attack on Russia through the geographically friendly, flat, great plains Ukraine by extending Russia to the Carpathian mountains</li>
                        <li>Raising the status of Russia by reclaiming the land of the former USSR</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Satisfying these goals may have different invasion profiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If Russia just wants Ukraine's energy resources, it can claim the bulk of them through claiming territory in the South and East. Crimea, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation" target="_blank">annexed by Russia in 2014</a> gives Russia claim to most of Ukraine's offshore oil. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas" target="_blank">War in Donbas and Luthansk</a> gives Russia claim to much of Ukraine's shale. However direct control of only these regions is not sufficient to claim their oil as Crimea depends on water from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Crimean_Canal" target="_blank">North Crimean Canal</a> which is currently under Ukrainian control and blocked. Thus, <em>at a minimum</em>, Russia must achieve control over southern Ukraine in order to make use of the claims it has already made. Note that control over just southern Ukraine would be precarious due to the friendly great plains geography that would span any southern region's border.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, for Russia to achieve other goals (geographic security, elimination of tariffs, increasing Russia's status), full control over Ukraine is necessary. Geographic security requires expanding to the Carpathian mountains in west Ukraine; existing oil infrastructure travels through west Ukraine; and claiming all of Ukraine will naturally be an impressive feat domestically. Note that geographic security does not just improve Russia's defensive position but also the defensive position of Crimea and Crimea's water security.
                    </p>
                <h2>Russian Security Interests</h2>
                    <p>
                        While the security concerns pertaining to the great plains geography of Ukraine are implicit in Putin's complaints about NATO encroachment eastward, I cannot imagine anyone believing this is a serious concern. Even if NATO did have a straightforward route into Russia through Ukraine, NATO would never take it unless Russia gave a very strong reason for it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This may sound like "if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear" but NATO's hesitation here is not because it expects Russia not to do anything bad; it's because Russia has nukes. A direct invansion of Russia, even by conventional military, would likely place Russia in immediate existential danger and result in the use of nuclear force or the triggering of mutually assured destruction. Based on NATO's extreme hesitance to get into a conflict with Russian troops even while they actively Ukraine, the idea that NATO go beyond that and threaten Russia directly seems implausible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this implausibility in mind, one might reach several conclusions about Russia's plans and concerns. Here are the ones that I'm considering: 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Russia intends to take some action so horrifying to NATO that it expects NATO to attempt an invasion of Russia, even if that invasion risks nuclear war</li>
                        <li>Russia is lying/overstating its security concerns to make NATO scared of expanding eastwards</li>
                        <li>Russia's security concerns as they pertain to Ukraine are unrelated to direct threats to Russia. Rather they pertain to the security of Russia's control over Crimea</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Personally, I think #1 is very unlikely. Russia's economy is reliant on its ability to sell gas to European nations and Putin seemed surprised at the severity of Western sanctions in response to his invasion. An action that would prompt a NATO invasion of Russia would cross far over the red line where such economic trade is possible. As a result, I believe Russia's claimed security concerns pertain only to its negotiation strategies and to its desire to maintain control of Crimea and the Donbas region.
                    </p>
                <h2>The Future of Ukraine</h2>
                    <p>
                        If the purpose of Russia's invasion is primarily to secure its control over Crimea, Donbas and Lunthansk, then the future of Ukraine is dark given a Russian victory. Russia would probably:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Claim the contested areas</li>
                        <li>Prevent Ukraine from getting closer to the West (the West might help Ukraine retake the contested areas)</li>
                        <li>Prevent Ukraine from having an independent military (the military might attempt to retake the contested areas)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The demilitarization might have been less aggressive if Russia had quickly and successfully decapitated Kyiv &#8212 the potential goodwill between Russia and Ukraine could allow Ukraine to officially concede the contested regions to Russia with a level of mutual trust. However, because of the current and future brutality of the invasion, those concessions will likely be unpalatable to the Ukrainian people. Thus, aggressive demilitarization.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, demilitarization will also be deeply unpalatable politically speaking. The only way to achieve such a thing would be for Russia to take harsh and brutal rule over Ukraine &#8212 consigning its people to a fate similar to that of Belarus.

                <h2>Updates on Russian Security Interests</h2>
                    <p>
                        From a material standpoint, Russia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkMlLkCRmRQ" target="_blank">geography and nuclear capabilities</a> reinforce my position that objective percception of NATO as a threat to Russia is overblown. Europe, and the West of the world, would prefer Russia to maintain its current shape to preserve the centralized management of its nuclear arsenal. However, I did not address the domestic benefits of making such overblown claims. Domestically, many Russians do view a West friendly Ukraine as posing a <a href="http://deryugina.com/a-view-from-russian-academia/" target="_blank">threat to Russia's security</a>. While these claims may be overblown on the global sphere, they are therefore useful domestically and for the purposes of propaganda. In any case, a majority of Russian's apparently support the war and Putin may gain support through those actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to this consideration, Russia's concern about the security risk posed by Ukraine may not pertain directly to ease-of invasion but rather potential impact on nuclear deterrents. In particular, NATO could potentially place anti-ballistic missile systems (ABMs) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_missile_defense_complex_in_Poland">like those considered in Poland</a> in Ukraine. While ABMs in eastern Europe might not protect the US from a nuclear barrage traveling over the north pole, they could significantly reduce the capacity for Russia to launch nuclear strikes on NATO states in Europe (that would travel from east-to-west over Ukraine, Poland, etc). If the US were to separate from NATO, this might expand opportunities for conflict with Russia with limited risk of nuclear blowback.
                    </p>

                <h2>December War Update</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since march, the war has progressed significantly with Ukraine successfully defending Kyiv and counter-attacking Russian forces to the east and south. Russia has sustained heavy sanctioning which has, for the most part, been ameliorated with access to technology and economic trade from non-Western countries (mainly China). With Sweden and Finland considering joining NATO directly, Russia's security posture will be much worsened, if that matters at all. Europe's energy positioning has been significantly worsened due to the conflict and their energy relations with Russia will probably be permanently impacted due to the explosions on the Nordstream pipelines. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking back, it appears that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The motivation for the Ukrainian War was to bring Ukraine under the domain of Russia, effectively conquering the country. While this was ambitious, it was likely that poor Russian intel led to a failure to accurately model the capabilities of the Ukrainian army
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The war has damaged everyone's economic situations and security postures.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the moment, the war appears to have reached a quasi-stalemate. China does not seem intent on assisting Russia from a military perspective to a meaningful degree while indirect (and perhaps covertly direct) NATO assistance has helped Ukraine regain much of the land Russia initially invaded. At this point, I think the most likely outcome is some unsatisfying negotiated peace and an economically and politically declining (but not existentially threatened) Russia.
