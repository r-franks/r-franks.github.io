            <h1>Basic Advice</h1>
                <p>
                    Google Maps is fairly mediocre at handling public transit in Chicago. It is useful for getting a broad sense of which trains/subways/buses you may want to use but can be bad when it comes to proposing specific timings. In particular:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Google Maps will often schedule transfers between routes with extremely tight temporal spacings, which cannot be performed by humans. Moreover, any slight delay (as will periodically occur on El trains, etc) may throw off the whole travel plan. For example, if you are planning to transfer from one El to another, Google Maps may propose taking a train that arrives 5:56 PM to a train that departs at 5:55 PM. The severity of this issue depends on how frequently run your routes are.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google Maps often gives times for El trains, etc that can be off by several minutes. The Ventra app usually provides more accurate/up-to-date information. Plan accordingly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    So your best bet for planning travel via CTA starts with identifying the routes you plan to use via Google Maps. But then, determine the specific timings of your routes using the Ventra app and manually add in the amount of padding that makes you comfortable (I usually add 10-15 min which may be on the excessive side). Finally (if you're as neurotic as I am), map each route on your travel plan individually as you initiate and complete it with Google Maps to get a sense of where you are.

            <h1>Commute Oriented Transit Systems</h1>
                <p>
                    Chicago's El system is clearly designed around transporting people into and out of the downtown area, The Loop. It is called the loop, naturally, because this is where the El system loops around. The loop is where the major business districts are located so the system's main function is to facilitate commutes to work and back home. For this purpose, the system works well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, being mainly about business, the loop is generally <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/25gxy5/is_it_true_that_the_loop_is_really_deserted_at/">lacking in nightlife</a> &#8212; which is more prominent in neighborhoods (e.g. Wicker Park, Lincoln Park, etc). As a result, the feasibility of meeting friends after work using the El boils down to whether you are both near the same El line into the loop or are willing to meet in the loop itself (not ideal compared to meeting in a neighborhood). Thus it doesn't happen. Neighborhoods on different El lines winds up de-facto isolated from each other, to almost the same extent that suburbs are. Romeo and Juliet are alas separated:

                </div>
                <p>
                    There are options that address this: Mercutio in Bucktown can give up on the El trains completely, and take a bus forty minutes north to Andersonville, 20 minutes east to Lincoln Park, and 10 minutes south to Wicker Park. However, if one is interested really convenient use of the El, it usually makes sense to commit to the red line or the blue line exclusively.

            <h1>East-West Travel and North-South Travel in North Chicago</h1>
                <p>
                    While Chicago has a lot of public transit, the El system is designed around access to downtown/the loop. On the North side, one has the red line and the brown-line which both travel along the lake until Irving Park (about as north as Wrigley Field), at which point the Brown line goes west a little bit before ending. The blue-line also exists, traveling roughly North-West at a 45 degree angle, passing through Wicker Park etc but never links up with the brown line. As a result, if you are north of the loop but south of Wrigley Field, <b>you cannot travel East-West via the El</b>. Buses exist, but are not particularly fast, so this means many relatively closely distanced locations in Chicago wind up extremely far away temporally due to differences in access El lines.

                <h2>An Illustrative Concert</h2>
                <p>
                    Say I want to go from <b>1002 N California Ave</b> (a bar in Humboldt) to <b>Metro, 3730 N Clark St</b> to enjoy a Girl in Red concert at 7PM. I can take the 65, 66 or 70 bus to the Red Line, or take the 94 bus to the 152 bus. Each of these routes take between 57 and 59 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Now</em> say I want to do the same thing from the North suburbs, starting at the <b>Lake Cook Rd Metra Stop</b> and going to the same place. I can take the MD-N to 80 bus or to the 152 bus. This takes 1 hr and 19-22 minutes. Despite almost <em>quadrupling</em> the distance from the city, the travel time has only increased 30%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This gets even worse if one aims further North in Chicago. <b>1002 N California Ave</b> to Andersonville works via th 66 or 70 bus to the 50 bus, taking 1 hr and 9-11 minutes. From the <b>Lake Cook Metra</b>, one can simply take the MD-N to the 92 bus in 1 hr and 24 minutes. For this purpose, living in Humboldt Park vs living in the suburbs constitutes a 15 minute change in commute. 
                <p>
                    To be fair, this demands on Suburban proximity to a train station. But, in my experience, getting to a station isn't very hard. This also isn't even the worst-case scenario. Imagine, instead of living in the suburbs, that you're a student at Northwestern University just getting out of the <b>Tech Building</b>. You walk to the purple line stop, ride it to the red line stop, and then walk in, taking 46 minutes total. Despite being roughly twice as far away from the destination, a Northwestern student can arrive to the concert ten minutes before a Chicago resident in Humboldt.
